You are helping me to extract text from an image of a chat conversation between me and my AI software IDE.

The IDE chat bot provides a few different types of messages, some are to update me in a conversational style and some are processing messages to do with the actions the IDE is taking. 

Text that is related to actions/processes the IDE is undertaking are normally in boxes with the text directed at me being outside the boxes.

Do not capture text that appears to be contained in boxes, only capture text that is directly outside of any boxes.

Messages from me are in a greybox that is right aligned with slightly smaller text, I do not want you to extract my messages to the IDE.

I will provide an image that has just been taken of the chat window.

I have previously extracted this text from the window:

``` recent text 

RECENT_TEXT

```

Please look at the image I have provided and extract any messages from the IDE that are not from me and not in an action box, I am looking for text that the IDE wants to say to me.

Avoid repeating text we have already extracted (i.e present in the recent text), I am only looking for new text in this image that we haven't already captured.

Please make sure you get all the text the IDE is saying to me and keep numbering and bullet points consistent with the image.

Please respond in the following JSON format:

{"text":["text line", "text line", "text line"...]}

If you do not find any new text, respond with an empty text array like this:

{"text":[]}

Only respond with a valid JSON object.
