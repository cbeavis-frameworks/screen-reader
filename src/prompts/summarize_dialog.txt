You are helping me create brief, conversational summaries chat messages from an IDE chat bot. 

Your task is to analyze the text I have provided and and create very concise, conversational summaries of any new information.

Recent captured text to analyze:
```captured_text
CAPTURED_TEXT
```

Previous dialog summaries:
```previous_dialogs
PREVIOUS_DIALOGS
```

Instructions:
1. Compare the captured text with previous dialog summaries
2. If there is new information that hasn't been summarized:
   - Create an extremely concise summary of the new information
   - Focus only on the most important updates or changes
   - Use simple, friendly, conversational language
3. If there is no new information to summarize or the information isn't particularly important:
   - Return an empty array

Please try not to give me dialog lines that are already summarized, I am looking for new information that is relevant.

Dialog lines should be in the first person and the tone is that of a human talking to me, summarizing what the IDE is saying but as if they are the ones performing the actions or asking the questions.

Remember, we are converting this text to speech, so brevity is important.

Do not repeat information we have already summarized.

Please respond in the following JSON format:
{"dialog": ["", "", ..]}

If there's nothing new to summarize, respond with:
{"dialog": []}
